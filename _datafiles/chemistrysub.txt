-Cyclobutyl bromide on treatment with magnesium in dry ether forms an organometallic (A). The organometallic reacts with ethanal to give an alcohol (B) after mild acidification. Prolonged treatment of alcohol (B) with an equivalent amount of HBr gives 1-bromo-1-methylcyclopentane (C). Write the structures of (A), (B) and explain how (C) is obtained from (B).

-A hydrocarbon (A) of molecular weight 54 reacts with an excess of Br2 in CCl4 to give a compound (B) whose molecular weight is 593% more than of (A). However, on catalytic hydrogenation with excess of hydrogen, (A) forms (C) whose molecular weight is only 7.4% more than that of (A). (A) reacts with CH3CH2Br in the presence of NaNH2 to give another hydrocarbon (D) which on ozonolysis yields diketone (E). (E) on oxidation gives propanoic acid. Give structures of (A) to (E) with reasons.
